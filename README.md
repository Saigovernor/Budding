## Problem Statement 
This month's challenge involves investigating at what weather conditions most bigfoot sightings occur. 

## Introduction 
**Bigfoot**, often known as Sasquatch, is an ape-like cryptid that cryptozoologists believe lives in North American woodlands. Bigfoot is frequently characterized as a huge, muscular, bipedal ape-like monster with black, dark brown, or dark reddish hair.  
For this dataset, there are 3 reporting types based on classification:    
1. Class A: Class A reports involve clear sightings in circumstances where misinterpretation or misidentification of other animals can be ruled out with greater confidence. For example, there are several footprint cases that are very well documented.  
2. Class B: Incidents where a possible sasquatch was observed at a great distance or in poor lighting conditions and incidents in any other circumstance that did not afford a clear view of the subject are considered Class B reports.  
3. Class C: Most second-hand reports, and any third-hand reports, or stories with an untraceable sources, are considered Class C, because of the high potential for inaccuracy.

## Project Layout 
This project was done using Microsoft Excel and Tableau.  

### Data cleaning 
This was done on Excel. The structure of the dataset was initially examined and it is observed that the dataset contains about 26 columns and about 95,580 rows before cleaning took place. After data cleaning, there were 26 columns and 94,910 rows after cleaning.  
The following steps were done during data cleaning: 
- removing duplicates 
- deleting empty cells   

### Data Visualization 
Visualization of this data was done using Tableau. Visualizations were made for important metrics like   
- number of sightings based on classification, 
- average temperature for bigfoot sightings, 
- visibity and Ultraviolet (UV) Index charts, 
- average windspeed, and 
- avergae humidity  
These metrics were used to form a dashboard which can be interacted with on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/DataDNAFebruaryVisualizationChallenge/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "Bigfoot dashboard")
